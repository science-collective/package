### 2022, January 17

With Hannah, Anders and Malene

- Nice to work with GitHub/Git outside of Statistics Denmark's servers again (HELLO WORLD!)
    + Couldn't find my old ssh key. GitHub doesn't allow pushing via ordinary security credentials (or I'm just stupid), so we need a resource on SSH/HTTPS/PAN or other methods of logging in. This is probably already covered in the beginner course.
- Hard to define unmet needs of researchers, not knowing what tools are out there.
    + Hannah shared a list of workflow tools listing more than 50 tools even 4 years ago https://github.com/jdblischak/r-project-workflows (e.g. "targets" https://books.ropensci.org/targets/ is not on the list)
    + We probably need to hear what preliminary results the scoping review finds, in order to avoid reinventing the wheel.
- Discussed (with Anders Askeland) the issue of sharing code only being half the work to reproducibility.
    + Some form of data to needs to accompany the code. Doesn't have to be source data, but has to represent the source data, ideally not just as a minimally reproducible example, but also in terms of general data properties (e.g. missings, distributions, outliers etc.)
    + I really need to try the sdcMicro package (CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sdcMicro/index.html, tutorial: https://sdcpractice.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to see if it can be applied to real-world research data disclosure in practice.
